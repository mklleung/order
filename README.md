# order
This web application is aimed towards creating a system which would allow students to order lunch from Louis' deli ahead of time. It features a three screen design, one for the customer, one for the cook, and one for the pick ups. The screen for the user allows them to order on a form just like the paper version. The screen for the cook displays all the active orders that have not been completed. The screen for pick ups displays all the orders that have been completed but not picked up yet. This web application features Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. There will soon be a voice integration feature which is aimed to allow the cooks to say "order 2 completed" and have it sent to the pick up page.
